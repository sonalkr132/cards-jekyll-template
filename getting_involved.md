# For Mentors

We are very excited to be involved in Google Summer of Code, but we can't do anything without mentors. Anyone can be a mentor, but we ideally look for folks with some domain expertise in the projects they mentor. You will be expected to put in at least 5-10 hours per week communicating with your student, and it will be up to assist the students and keep them on task throughout the summer.

You'll be able to apply to be a mentor once applications open for 2016.

# For Students

Students will also be able to apply once applications open for 2016, but they can start working on proposals now! Proposals should include plans for the summer, including a development timeline, time estimates with reasonable, frequent milestones, and a plan to mitigate unexpected difficulties.

Have a look at our [ideas page](Ideas List) or come up with some ideas of your own.

# Group Chat


A lot of mentors and students hang out at the `#rubygsoc` channel on the Bundler/RubyGems Slack account. You can join in by [filling your email in on this page](https://bundler-slackin.herokuapp.com).

# Mailing List

Ruby's GSoC also has a mailing list, the [rubygsoc google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/rubygsoc).
